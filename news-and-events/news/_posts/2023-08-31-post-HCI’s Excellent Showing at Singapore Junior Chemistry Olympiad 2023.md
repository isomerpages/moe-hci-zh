SJChO is a competition jointly organised by the Singapore National Institute of Chemistry (SNIC) in partnership with National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/), [Institute of Materials Research and Engineering](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/imre) and The Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment, and supported by the Ministry of Education.

In this competition,  upper secondary students (or equivalent levels) challenge themselves in their chemical knowledge and skills. SJChO also serves to promote excitement in learning and doing Chemistry, as well as a platform to identify and develop chemistry talents. 

The teacher in charge of HCI’s SJChO team, Mr Rudy Lee, shared that it was fulfilling to oversee the SJChO training and see the growth of the students as they mastered advanced Chemistry concepts and developed their passion in the subject in the process. Mr Rudy Lee was supported by the Chemistry department and alumnus trainer, Flanders Eiw.
