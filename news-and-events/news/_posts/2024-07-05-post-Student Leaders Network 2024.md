<p>On 30 and 31 May 2024, over 170 student leaders from schools across Singapore
gathered at the High School Section for the inaugural Student Leaders Network
(SLN). This 2-day Leadership Workshop cum Networking Session was organised
by student leaders from the 51st Students’ Council (High School) and co-facilitated
with Nanyang Girls’ High School. Themed “Culture”, the network aimed to
connect student leaders across Singapore to forge meaningful relationships
through collaborative learning.</p>

<p>Across the two days of networking, delegates discussed their leadership
experiences and looked into the importance of culture-building as a crucial
element of student leadership. Delegates also worked together to ideate
strategies that could be adopted to enhance their abilities to serve their
communities by empowering themselves and those around them. Alongside the
insightful discussions during the networking session, delegates also participated
in a plethora of programmes, which as one student leader reflected, "helped
to build a strong sense of camaraderie and friendship between the student
leaders from schools across Singapore.</p>
