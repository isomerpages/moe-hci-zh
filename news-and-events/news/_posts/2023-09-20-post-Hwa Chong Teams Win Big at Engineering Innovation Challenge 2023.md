On 26 Aug 2023, three teams from Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) took home the first, second and third prizes for Engineering Innovation Challenge (EIC) 2023 amidst stiff competition from 137 local and international teams. The award ceremony was held at ITE College Central’s Tay Eng Soon Convention Centre on the last day of National Engineers Day (NED) 2023. The award ceremony was graced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat.

The theme of this year’s EIC was “_Shaping a Circular Economy through Engineering”_, which tasked youth participants with developing design prototypes to enhance the resilience of city living in Singapore. Each team was mentored by both a teacher mentor from HCI and a practicing engineer from the Institution of Engineers Singapore (IES).

The champion team proposed an eco-friendly solution for pharmaceutical packaging through the development of biodegradable starch-based plastic packaging from food waste.&nbsp;

&gt; _“This competition was a fantastic learning experience for our team. Our experience working with starch-based bioplastics has taught us that even the humblest solutions can have big impacts!”_
