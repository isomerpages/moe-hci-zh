<p>Singapore Secondary School Debating Championships 2024 has concluded,
and we are proud to announce that our team has attained spectacular results.</p>
<p>Over 6 debates that took place across 9 weeks, our Hwa Chongians put up
a strong fight against tough competition from schools across Singapore,
bringing us to the Grand Finals against Raffles Institution on 19 Apr 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a 4-1 split decision, Hwa Chong was crowned Champions for the first
time since 2016, with Zhang XiaoYu (4i4) named the Best Speaker in the
Finals.&nbsp;</p>
