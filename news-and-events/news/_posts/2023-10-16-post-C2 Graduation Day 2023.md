The C2 students reminisced about their time in Hwa Chong through watching their class montages containing fond memories of their two years as a class. In a bittersweet moment nearing the close of the ceremony, the C2 students sang familiar songs as a batch for the very last time, echoing their hope for the future and their appreciation and nostalgia for the good times they had in the school.
