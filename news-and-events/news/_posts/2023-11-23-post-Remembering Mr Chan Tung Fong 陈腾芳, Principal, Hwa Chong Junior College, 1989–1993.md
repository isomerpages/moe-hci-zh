The Hwa Chong family is saddened by the passing of Mr Chan Tung Fong, Principal, Hwa Chong Junior College (HCJC) from 1989 to 1993. 

Mr Chan led HCJC at key points of transition. When he joined HCJC, the college was at its temporary site at Bukit Batok. This was a challenging time with the school balancing the student learning needs and enrollment considerations while managing infrastructural aspects of both the temporary and upgrading campuses. Mr Chan and his team focused on meeting student needs while building up the momentum of anticipation and future-looking opportunities. This led to the resounding restart and return to our current Bukit Timah campus on 29 December 1991.

During Mr Chan’s leadership, HCJC became one of the pioneer junior colleges to offer the Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP), when the course was introduced in 1990. With the offering of both the CLEP and the Humanities Programme, HCJC steadily established its hallmark of being a college that nurtures bicultural talents and where the best of the east and west could flourish in tandem.

We are grateful for his contributions to education and remember his leadership and service during his tenure as our HCJC Principal.
