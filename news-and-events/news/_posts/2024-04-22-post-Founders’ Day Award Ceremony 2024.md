<p>Our students were recognised for their exemplary performance across various
domains. Awards were presented for outstanding academic achievement, bilingualism
and biculturalism, trilingualism, exceptional performance in CCAs and extracurricular
activities, as well as model student awards.</p>

on his journey at Hwa Chong Institution and the values that have guided
his success. His words served as a source of inspiration for his peers
and a reminder of the transformative power of determination and perseverance.</p>
<p>In addition to student accolades, we had the privilege of welcoming two
distinguished alumni, specialist general surgeon, Dr. Teh Jun Liang and
market team head, Mr. Ng Chee Chye, who graced the occasion with their
presence and shared valuable words of wisdom and encouragement with our
students. Their remarkable achievements and contributions serve as shining
examples of the impact that Hwa Chong Institution alumni can have on the
community around us.</p>
