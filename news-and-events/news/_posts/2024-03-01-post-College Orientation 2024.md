<p>On 2 Feb 2024, there was a hustle and bustle of activity on our campus
as we warmly welcomed the first year college students (C1s) into our Hwa
Chong family and commenced the start of an exhilarating journey that awaits
them! Truly, there is no better way to kickstart their extraordinary adventure
than with a fun-filled orientation that has long served as a rite of passage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In line with the theme “Valiance”, this year’s orientation, which was
meticulously prepared by Hwa Chong’s Students’ Council, sought to highlight
the courageous qualities of our intrepid C1s with exciting activities spanning
across the week!&nbsp;</p>
<p>From not knowing one another to forging formidable friendships within
their orientation groups (OGs), orientation had nothing short of laughter,
engagement, and memories worth keeping for a lifetime. Icebreakers and
water games on the Astroturf were more than just a splash of fun!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the merciless sunshine, the unwavering attitude of the Hwa Chong
family’s newest additions shone even brighter. Be it the invigorating school
cheers echoing through the campus, or the heartwarming singing during SODACHE,
the Hwa Chong spirit undeniably reverberated throughout the walls of our
second home.</p>

<p>The setting up of well-crafted orientation decorations by the various
faculties soon marked the end of the first half of orientation, and our
C1s got to meet their Civics Groups (CGs) on 14 Feb. Through each Faculty
Committee’s thoughtfully designed games, C1s got to form tight-knit friendships
within the classes that will accompany them through their JC journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 2 of CG orientation brought about a new challenge: War games! C1s
from all 4 faculties battled hard against one another, each defending their
own towers and attacking the others, while spectators cheered their hearts
out for their respective coloured shirts.</p>

<p>As orientation drew to a close, the campfire roared to life, as the C1s
sang, danced, and cheered together as a Hwa Chong family, a night that
would truly remain a core memory for all.</p>

<p>
<br>Last but not least, the C1s had prepared tirelessly throughout their CG
orientation days for the long-awaited Post-Orientation Party (POP) on 21st
Feb! Everyone danced their hearts out as the night dawned upon us, and
it was truly a sight to behold, embodying what it means to be 4 Facs 1
