<p>From 17-21 June, our delegates engaged in stimulating exchanges with peers
from Citipointe Christian College (Brisbane), Diocesan Girls’ School (Hong
Kong), and Bugil Academy (Cheonan). Together, they refined their research
skills in Humanities and Social Sciences, exchanged cultural insights,
and formed lasting international friendships.</p>

<p>Centered on the theme of Yin and Yang, our students were inspired by keynote
speakers Professor Yujin Kim and Professor Soohan Kim, who shared perspectives
on Korea’s job market stress and societal inclusivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor Yujin Kim, Assistant Professor from the International Business
Division at Sogang Business School, discussed stress in Korea’s increasingly
competitive job environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor Soohan Kim, from Korea University’s Sociology Department, emphasised
the importance of diversity and inclusivity for societal progress.</p>
<p>Delegates’ presentations ranged from personality types shaping social
dynamics to delving into generational trauma in Disney’s Encanto. Each
presentation group was challenged with thought-provoking questions from
all participating schools.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, our delegates enjoyed an adventure at Lotte World. They
immersed themselves in Korean culture at the Hanboknam Korean Folk Village
and savoured local delicacies at Myeongdong Night Market. The experience
culminated in a dazzling performance at The Painters’ Show.</p>

<p>Aaron Tan Rui Ze (3i4) reflected, “Humanity is not a gift that can be
conferred upon others; it is our inherent responsibility.” Embodying compassion
and respect is not merely an option but a fundamental principle undergirding
our very existence. Our actions must consistently reflect this intrinsic
duty, highlighting the essential role of humanity in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>We eagerly anticipate the 17th iteration of HRSY in Hong Kong!</p>
