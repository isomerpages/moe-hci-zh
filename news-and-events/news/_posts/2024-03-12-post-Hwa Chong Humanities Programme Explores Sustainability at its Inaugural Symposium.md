<p><strong><u>Hwa Chong Humanities Programme Explores Sustainability at its Inaugural Symposium</u></strong>
</p>
<p>History, one of Hwa Chong’s more popular humanities subjects, was on everyone’s
mind at the inaugural HCI Humanities Programme (HP) Symposium, and not
for academic reasons. Instead, the rich history of HP was celebrated throughout
the symposium- a gathering of almost 200 students from different junior
colleges, secondary schools, and talent programmes within the college.</p>
<p>Centering around the theme of “We, The Sustainable Citizens”, the symposium
was kicked off by an engrossing speech by Principal Lee Peck Ping, who
emphasised the importance of interdisciplinary dialogue in “future transformations
and breakthroughs'', especially when pertaining to the creation of sustainable
practices and innovations in the nation. This spirit of cross-collaboration
was especially strong during the symposium, as Science Math Talent Programme
(SMTP) and Art Elective Programme (AEP) students from the college section
joined the humanities students as enthusiastic participants throughout
the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The opening remarks were followed by a blast from the past- an insightful
panel discussion from HP alumni Chong Lingying (07A15), Jian Yang Hoh (07A15),
Shawn Teo (09A14), and Kylie Liu (11A15). With their varying educational
and professional experiences ranging from publisher to public servant,
the panellists responded to questions about their life experiences, the
partnership of STEM fields with the humanities, and sustainability with
expertise and humour, fondly reminiscing about their days in Hwa Chong
and charting out their hopes for a greener future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a short refreshment break, concurrent Capstone presentations from
the C2 HP cohort commenced in rooms named after key HP tutors of the past,
with the “Premier Miles Lounge” and “Perry’s Theatre” being dedicated to
Mr Nick Miles and Mr Nicholas Perry respectively, in recognition of their
tireless efforts in making the programme a vibrant community of passionate
learners. The C2s embodied these traits as they showcased the findings
of their year-long interdisciplinary projects. Ranging from field trips
to urban farms, the construction of virtual malls, feeding the future and
more, the projects all aimed to bring the Singapore one step closer to
achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #11 of Sustainable
Cities and Communities. After their presentations, participants listened
to advice and comments by the panellists, before starting spirited discussions
on how each project could be improved.</p>

<p>As students proceeded to depart the school for their March holiday breaks,
their terms were capped off with a renewed sense of purpose and satisfaction,
with Katriel, a C2 student from Eunoia Junior College remarking that the
symposium left her “feeling inspired and enlightened by the future”. Others
especially enjoyed rare space to discuss the humanities with like-minded
peers, as Finna, a C1 from Raffles Institution, noted that she “felt very
comfortable sharing [her] thoughts as everyone was bonded through our common
passion for the humanities which allowed us to engage in discussions effectively”,
before expressing her love for such a humanities community&nbsp;</p>
