<p>Their innovative project, "Investigating the Use of Eggshells as an Anti-Bacterial
Agent and in the Removal of Heavy Metal Ions in Water," has earned them
two prestigious awards: Global Choice Award - Voted by American science
fair participants, and Impact Award - Recognizing the project with the
most real-world impact.</p>
<p>This project seeks to use eggshells to purify polluted water and early
tests show promise for low-cost, accessible water purification.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Yuheng and Jerrell for their outstanding contributions
to scientific innovation and their impactful achievements!</p>
