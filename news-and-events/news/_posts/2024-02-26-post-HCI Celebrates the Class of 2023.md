<p><strong>HCI Celebrates the Class of 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>23 Feb 2024</p>
<p>The Class of 2023 has once again achieved excellent performance at the
A-Level Examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cohort has demonstrated the importance of discovering peaks of excellence,
locating their various passions, and creating impact through their various
contributions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the first post-pandemic cohort, we celebrate their steadfast commitment
in contributing to the wider community amidst their demanding schedules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demonstrating their commitment to excellence, this cohort sustained a&nbsp;<strong>median UAS</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of</strong>&nbsp;<strong>88. One out of four</strong> had
a perfect <strong>UAS of 90</strong>. <strong>Six out of 10</strong> attained <strong>3 H2 Distinctions and above</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>We are proud that our students continue to flourish, embodying the values
of grit, adaptability and compassion. These are all hallmarks of the Hwa
Chong spirit of 自强不息 and 饮水思源.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Channeling their efforts to uplifting others, the Class of 2023 took on <strong>128 </strong>Service
Learning Projects and impacted <strong>close to 210</strong> organizations
and their beneficiaries. We hope that this school value of 己立立人 , 己达达人
will guide them through life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Over 750 students or 75% of the cohort have been conferred the Hwa Chong Diploma for holistic excellence; and</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They took home <strong>45</strong>  <strong>Top 3 titles</strong> at the <strong>National Schools Games</strong>; <strong>13 Distinctions and 1&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Certificate of Accomplishment </strong>at
the Singapore Youth Festival Presentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A testament to the value of a Hwa Chong education, numerous offers have
been made to Hwa Chong students both from local universities as well as
established overseas universities. Our students also continue to be part
of many prestigious university scholarship programmes which seek to nurture
interdisciplinary thinkers, changemakers and leaders for the nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provisional scholarships such as the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship
have been offered to Hwa Chong students before the release of the A-level
results. This is evidence of the confidence and trust that our stakeholders
have in our students’ all-round qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Our gratitude also goes out to all educators in our students’ primary
and secondary school journeys, as well as parents and alumni who have always
been the supportive pillars for our students. We want to specially acknowledge
and thank all the staff of Nanyang Girls’ High School and HCI for their
unwavering care and commitment.</p>
<p>As our graduates enter the next phase of their lives, we will continue
in our steadfast mission to nurture our next generation of students to
live with passion and lead with compassion. We encourage all to look beyond
academic grades as the only measure of success, embrace a myriad of opportunities,
and pursue holistic excellence.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Hwa Chong Celebrates Holistic Excellence</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2023! They have demonstrated
exceptional talent in areas of their diverse interests, and made meaningful
contributions to the wider community. Being the inaugural cohort after
the pandemic, we commend their unwavering dedication to enriching the broader
community despite facing demanding schedules.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Hwa Chong experience goes well beyond academic excellence. All students
undergo a holistic education programme which empowers students to pursue
their passion and serve the community. We would like to celebrate the achievements
of a few of our students who especially embody the Hwa Chong vision for
her students to ‘Live with Passion, Lead with compassion’</p>
