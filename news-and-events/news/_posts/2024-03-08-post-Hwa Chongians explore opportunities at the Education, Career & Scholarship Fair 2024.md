<p>The event presented an excellent opportunity for students to explore various
educational and career opportunities, as well as potential scholarships
to support their future aspirations.</p>
<p>
<br>

<p>Engaging panel discussions tackled perennial questions that students have
about their future. One session was held at the College Auditorium and
explored the grey area of how students are to decide what is next for them.
The esteemed speakers include CPT Russell Ewe, Staff Officer at the Republic
of Singapore Navy, Professor Terrence Sim, Vice Dean of Admissions at the
National University of Singapore, and Rui Xin Oh, Senior Project Manager
at brand experience agency, INVNT.ATOM.</p>
