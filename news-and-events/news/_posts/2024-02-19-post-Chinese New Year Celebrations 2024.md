<p>At the High School, the festivities commenced with a heartfelt address
by HCI‚Äôs principal, Mr Lee Peck Ping. Mr Lee wished everyone good fortune
in the year ahead, setting the tone for a celebration that not only commemorated
the Lunar New Year but also highlighted the school's commitment to cultural
diversity and unity. The stage then came alive with a series of captivating
performances, from our very own Chinese Drama, Chinese Orchestra, Music
and Dance (Chinese) and Military Band CCAs. The audience was also enthralled
with an engaging game show segment, and eagerly cheered their hearts out
during a contest for the best-decorated classroom.&nbsp;</p>
