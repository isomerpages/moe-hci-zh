<p><strong><u>Staff Learning Day 2024: PLAY@HCI</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“We don’t stop playing because we grow old. We grow old because we stop playing.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>~George Bernard Shaw</em>
</p>
<p>On February 15th, 2024, Hwa Chong Institution took a leap into a new era
of staff engagement with the inaugural "PLAY@HCI" festival, embodied by
a day dedicated to fostering a vibrant and “playful” staff community. The
event kicked off as staff from all across Hwa Chong gathered for a day
filled with custom-tailored workshops and engaging bonding activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The morning session was dedicated to professional development through
a series of Staff-led Workshops. These workshops covered a range of topics
designed to enhance the skill set of our dedicated staff members. From
Assessment Literacy to exploring the realms of ChatGPT, staff had the opportunity
to delve into diverse subjects, fostering an environment of continuous
learning.</p>

<p>The workshops not only equipped our staff with new skills but also provided
a platform for knowledge-sharing and collaboration. It was inspiring to
witness our educators and non-teaching staff actively participating in
sessions that aimed to elevate their professional capabilities and contribute
to the collective growth of Hwa Chong.</p>
<p><em>"It was an enriching and meaningful experience - not only did I learn more about ChatGPT (thanks Mr Justin Heng!) but I also got to meet new people and make new friends."</em>

</p>
<p>The heart of PLAY@HCI lies in appreciating each member of our staff community.
The festival was a celebration of the diverse talents and contributions
that make Hwa Chong Institution an exceptional place to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“I was happy to share on the everyday use of ChatGPT and how to improve prompt design to obtain better output. It was also encouraging that many colleagues were excited to learn more and asked many questions during the hands-on session.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>- Justin Heng (HCI educator and workshop facilitator)</em>

<p>The afternoon was dedicated to fostering connections through an array
of bonding activities. Sports enthusiasts engaged in friendly basketball
matches, while others explored their creative side with recreational activities
such as soap making or cake decorating. Laughter echoed across the campus
as staff members participated in team-building exercises and shared moments
of joy and relaxation.</p>
