On 16 Oct 2023, 12 student facilitators from Hwa Chong Institution collaborated with 34 Secondary 3 students from Beatty Secondary School for a 2-hour workshop on Food Chemistry.&nbsp;

The participants choose between attending a jam making workshop titled "What is grandma's secret recipe?" and a molecular gastronomy (vegan egg making) workshop. During the workshops, student facilitators and participants cooked up a storm while discussing the chemical processes involved through guided inquiry worksheets.&nbsp;

The collaboration will continue in the first semester of 2024, with Hwa Chongians attending workshops in Beatty Secondary School’s food science laboratories.

The workshop organisers have this to say about their experience:

<i> "This unique opportunity was a valuable learning experience in integrating chemistry into culinary endeavors. The process was not just about finding recipes; it involved understanding the chemical reactions that underpin them." </i><br>Zou Jiaxin 23S6G

<i>"We usually think of Chemistry as a subject that we will be tested on, but it is much more than that. The collaboration with Beatty Sec showed how chemistry is fun and can be applied to many things in our life."</i><br>Wong Jin Rou 23S6P
