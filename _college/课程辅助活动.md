Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part of every Hwa Chongian's life. We offer a wide and diverse range of CCAs across 4 main groups; <b>Service &amp; Enrichment, Sports &amp; Games, Visual &amp; Performing Arts, and Student Committees</b>

Our CCAs are at the forefront of their respective fields, with some winning championships and accolades at the National level, and some Hwa Chongians representing Singapore on an international stage. 

CCA leaders in HCI (College) may be elected to the CCA Council, a student committee dedicated to maximise the potential of each individual CCA and contribute to directing CCA policies. CCA Council also hosts inter-CCAevents such  like CCA Appreciation Week, CCA Leaders &amp; EXCO Workshops.

Students may also be elected to the Hwa Chong Students' Council, a body of student councillors dedicated to serving the school. The Students' Council assists in the planning, organisation, and administration of the College's 7 flagship events, such as Open House and Orientation. They also create and contribute to day-to-day initiatives to benefit the student population.
