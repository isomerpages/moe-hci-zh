# Subjects Offered


#### **Economics** 
The Economics Unit in Hwa Chong comprises a team of dynamic professionals dedicated to the teaching of Economics as a life subject. Economics is not just a collection of facts but a unified approach to thinking about the world. The theory of Economics is an apparatus of the mind or a technique of thinking which helps us make rational decisions. With these requirements in mind, the Economics Unit provides a rigorous course to equip students with the skills necessary for economics awareness and competence. This course imparts both intellectual as well as citizenship training through a well-planned syllabus to promote understanding of the very processes and issues that affect their lives as citizens and students. In addition, Economics Exco was set up to expose students to a range of enriching experiences such as participation in nation-wide competitions, publication of newsletters and trips to overseas to EU and Universities for Summer Programmes. The greatest reward of this course is a better understanding of how the world works.

#### **Geography**
<q>Geography is the study of Earth’s landscapes, peoples, places and environments... <b>
bridging the social sciences with the natural sciences... and puts [the]  understanding of social and physical processes within the context of places and regions... <b>[Geography]</b> helps us all to be more socially and environmentally sensitive, informed and responsible citizens...  </b></q><b><br>
	
<b>Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)</b>

The approach to Geography teaching and learning in Hwa Chong has evolved through the years due to the changing demands of the syllabus and the growing interest amongst the students in the subject. As Geography is an applied discipline, practicing geographers should be able to make direct contributions to society. Being highly dynamic, the subject constantly seeks to heighten our awareness of the world. It introduces the processes operative in physical and human geography and draws links to how these are relevant to the current social, economic, political and environmental situation.&nbsp; Hence, with these attributes in mind, the syllabus seeks to encourage students to:

1\. be inspired by the splendour of natural environments and human ingenuity;  
2\. care for delicate ecosystems and understand the importance of environmentally sustainable lifestyles;  
3\. develop as global citizens, seek harmony and respect others in a culturally diverse world;  
4\. contribute responsibly towards the building of a robust and inclusive society; and  
5\. have the integrity to uphold ethical principles and be resilient in their pursuit for a better world.

These aims are achieved through the study of the main Themes in the H2 Geography syllabus:  
Theme 1 : Tropical Environments  
Theme 2 : Development, economy and the Environment  
Theme 3 : Sustainable Development  
Theme 4 : Geographical Investigation

At Hwa Chong, we also aim to develop students with a global perspective, imbued with the spirit of inquiry and empathy which would enable them to respond to on-going changes. Tutors actively integrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills into content learning. They facilitate experiential learning to promote creativity and make Geography come alive. IT is also employed to enhance learning.&nbsp; These emphases are in line with the&nbsp;**Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE)**. Upon completion of their formal education, Geography students should emerge as a/an:

1.&nbsp;**confident person**&nbsp;who has a strong sense of right and wrong, is adaptable and resilient, knows himself/herself, is discerning in judgement, thinks independently and critically, and communicates effectively;  
2.&nbsp;**self-directed learner**&nbsp;who questions, reflects, perseveres and takes responsibility for his/her own learning;  
3.&nbsp;**active contributor**&nbsp;who is able to work effectively in teams, is innovative, exercises initiative, takes calculated risks and strives for excellence; and  
4.&nbsp;**concerned citizen**&nbsp;who is rooted to Singapore, has a strong sense of civic responsibility, is informed about Singapore and the world, and takes an active part in bettering the lives of others around him/her.

One key area that has gained prominence is the adoption of fieldwork in the study of Geography. Local field studies and overseas field trips are conducted each year in connection with topics covered during the course.&nbsp; These are efforts made to address the requirements of the theme on Geographical Investigation.&nbsp; All students will embark on detailed studies of both physical and human phenomena such as flooding and activities involving transnational corporations.&nbsp;

#### **History**

In an era where national boundaries are fast disappearing in an increasingly globalised world, the need to understand the world around us has become more imperative. Towards this end, one key objective of the History Unit is to foster a keen interest among students in past and current affairs and understanding them with critical depth. Besides nurturing a passion for the subject, the Unit is also committed to developing critical thinking and analytical skills in our students. Students are encouraged to read widely and do independent research.

Under the Hwa Chong Integrated Humanities Framework, Years 1-2 constitute the Exploration phase where students offer both History and Geography. Upon Entering the Development Phase in Years 3-4, students may further develop their passion by offering History either as one of the Integrated Humanities Electives or HP History under the Humanities Programme @ High School. During the Consolidation phase of Years 5-6, students are expected to be independent learners within and outside the classroom. They are exposed to the rigours of the GCE 'A' Level curriculum which demands more in-depth and considered written responses.

In order to pursue our objectives, the Unit provides a myriad of opportunities for our students. Lectures are building blocks for knowledge acquisition while tutorials provide the platform for them to consolidate their knowledge and discuss issues. Students are also given opportunities to hone their examination techniques through term assignments, essay tests and examinations.

Of course, the subject is not just about tomes and the dreaded examinations. A wide spectrum of co-curricular activities is available to students to pursue their passion in the subject. These include the annual model UN Conferences and various competitions organised by local varsities such as the NUS Arts Quiz and NTU Current Affairs Quiz. Attending seminars on various topics of interest also help students stay in touch with the subject in the real world context. Volunteer opportunities in local museums are also open to our students.

In recent years, the Unit has taken students on overseas field trips to places of historical interest and significance. In 2005, students caught a glimpse of life after the fall of the Berlin Wall and end of the Cold War in a trip to Germany and Czech Republic. Last year, students visited the Cold War behemoth, the ex-Soviet Union in a whirlwind tour which took them to Moscow and St. Petersburg. More recently, History students visited the United States on an Integrated Humanities trip and caught a glimpse of what makes the world's remaining superpower tick. This year, we made our way to Vietnam and were marvelled at the strides this communist country has made since the introduction of reforms in the late 1980s and the resilience that Vietnamese people displayed during the Vietnam War.

So, what are you waiting for? Get in here for an exciting journey through time and space.

#### **English Language/General Paper**

The goal of the English Language Programme at HCI is to develop independent thinkers who can see the connection between language study and its application to life. A holistic educational approach ensures that students are given the freedom to intellectually grasp these relationships and apply them to authentic tasks.

Adopting a multi-pronged approach, the Hwa Chong H1 General Paper curriculum comprises a broad variety of stimulating modules designed to develop all-round individuals.&nbsp; A theme-based reading and writing programme is offered at the College level, and the topics covered include the mass media, environment, science and technology, culture and tradition, politics and government, conflicts and violence, and citizenship in Singapore.

Knowledge &amp; Inquiry (KI) is a multi-disciplinary H2 A-Level subject that explores the different fields of knowledge and applies various modes of inquiry to a range of issues and ideas.&nbsp; The subject aims to develop students' ability to critically evaluate arguments and engage in independent research.&nbsp; Students can offer KI as a contrasting subject.&nbsp; As the 4th H2 subject, KI will be offered by students who are academically able to cope with 4 H2 subjects on top of other H1 subjects.&nbsp; KI is also taken in lieu of General Paper.&nbsp; In Hwa Chong, we are looking for bright students who are linguistically competent and have an inquiring mind.&nbsp; KI students are expected to read widely and they must be highly proficient in written English as well as independent learners.

Literature in English aims to develop in students an informed appreciation of literature and a love of reading. Students who read the subject would be equipped with literary skills to understand the nature and methods of literary study and analysis. The Literature in English programme in HCI, entails a rigorous study of the three main literary genres (Poetry, Prose, Drama), in-depth analysis of award-winning literary writers and their works, and an annual enrichment component.

H2 English Language and Linguistics (ELL) exposes students to a range of linguistic concepts and methods appropriate for the analysis and study of the English language, so as to understand the contexts in which the language operates, think about the issues and debates that surround its usage, and respond critically to them. Through the study of the English language, students will develop their competence as users of English. The H2 English Language and Linguistics (ELL) programme at HCI is seminar-styled, and focuses on mastering fundamental linguistic concepts before moving on to using these concepts to explore language issues related to wider societal concerns. Independent reading and essay writing are characteristic of the subject.

#### **Mathematics**

The Hwa Chong Mathematics Department sees the subject as an excellent means for the development of an individual's intellectual ability in logical reasoning, spatial visualisation, and abstract thought. It is our belief that a strong foundation in Mathematics is crucial to the development of not only a highly skilled but scientifically- and technologically- competent workforce that can meet the challenges of the 21st century. From Years 1 to 4, we focus on developing students’ critical and creative skills and their ability to communicate and reason mathematically, through the use of an inquiry based approach with ICT infusion. We also foster a conducive environment that provides students with opportunities to use Mathematics in solving real-world problems and doing in-depth research in projects. In moving learning beyond the classroom, we hope to instill in students the spirit of continual and inquiry learning and an appreciation of the beauty and value of mathematics.
