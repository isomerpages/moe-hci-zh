The revised JC curriculum introduces a set of subjects at H3 level to target the top 10% to 15% of the GCE A-level cohort of students each year who have exceptional interest and ability in a particular subject. The intention is to further stretch these students to achieve&nbsp;peaks of excellence&nbsp;within the context of a broad-based education. It also allows students to engage in different forms of learning and research work.

Thus, H3 subjects should be offered by students who are&nbsp;**academically able**&nbsp;to cope with additional subject(s) on top of their minimum subject requirement. The approach adopted by H3 subjects is one in which it is an extension of what is covered in H2 subject but in a more specialised area where students will be stretched further with substantial deep learning.

**Note**

1\. The&nbsp;**maximum number of H3 subjects**&nbsp;allowed is&nbsp;**TWO**.  
2\. The&nbsp;**total number of academic units**&nbsp;offered by students (inclusive of H3 subjects)&nbsp;cannot exceed 12.

Students can apply for H3 subjects offered by

**a. &nbsp;University-taught H3 programmes**&nbsp;(NUS, NTU and SMU)  
**b. &nbsp;Extended, in-depth research**&nbsp;(SRP, NRP, NTU-A\*STAR-HCI&nbsp;and&nbsp;HSSR)  
**c.&nbsp; MOE-CAMBRIDGE H3,**&nbsp;taught in-house in Hwa Chong Institution (HCI)

#### **Selection Criteria for MOE-CAMBRIDGE H3 Subjects**

a.&nbsp;**Mean Subject Grade (MSG) 2.8 or better for content based subjects**

MSG is calculated for all H1, H2 content based subjects after C1 Overall Results are released.&nbsp;**Annex**&nbsp;shows the scoring points system and the formula used in computing the MSG. This criterion ensures that only students of the right calibre are selected. Prospective H3 students must be able to cope well in all subjects that are offered.

b.&nbsp;_**Within top 20th percentile ranking for the intended subject at H2 level**_

**Remarks**

Listed in the table below are the recommended number of H3 subjects that can be offered for the various subject combinations taken by JC2 students. The intent is to ensure that students are given ample time and space to pursue their interest and passion in one or more H3 subjects while developing themselves holistically in non-academic areas.
|Subject Combinations|Recommended No. of H3 offered|
| -------- | -------- |
|3 H2, 1 H1|Up TO 2 H3|
|4H2 (No KI)|Up to 1 H3 / Up to 2 H3 for H2 CLL students|
|4H2 (With KI)|Up TO 2 H3|
|4H2 (With KI), 1 H1|Up TO 1 H3|

Students can appeal to read an MOE-Cambridge H3 subject if they do not meet the selection criteria. Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis by HCI H3 Selection Committee. The student eligibility list for MOE-Cambridge H3 will be released on&nbsp;**25 Oct 2023**&nbsp;via ISP. Students who are not eligible can make an appeal by submitting the appeal form through ISP from&nbsp;**25 Oct 2023 to 27 Oct 2023**.
