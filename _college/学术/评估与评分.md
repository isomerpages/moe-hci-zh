#### **(A) Mean Subject Grade**

The grades of H1 and H2 subjects are assigned an equivalent point according to the table below:


|H1/H2 Grade|Equivalent Points|
| -------- | -------- |
|A|1|
|B|2|
|C|3|
|D|4|
|E|5|
|S|6|
|Ungraded|7|

#### **(B) Computation of Points**

Mean Subject Grade&nbsp;is calculated based on the following formula:

[2 (Sum of all H2 grades) + (Sum of all H1 content-based subject grades)]  / [2(No. of H2 subjects) + (No. of H1 content subjects)]

**Examples**

Student A takes 3 H2 and 1 H1 subjects.


||Mathematics (H2)|Physics (H2)|Chemistry (H2)|Economics (H1)| 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Grade|A|B|C|D|
|Points|1|2|3|4|

MSG =&nbsp;[2(1+ 2+ 3) + 4]&nbsp;\ [2(3) + 1] = 2.29  

Student B takes 4 H2 subjects.
||Mathematics (H2)|Physics (H2)|Chemistry (H2)|Economics (H2)| 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Grade|A|B|C|D|
|Points|1|2|3|4|

MSG = (1 + 2+ 3+ 4) / 4 = 2.5.

**Reporting**

There are 2 main methods of reporting student progress to parents:

1\.  Through progress report in end March, mid year (both JC 1 and 2) and at the end of the school year (for JC1). Aformal transcript for JC2 students will be issued after the school's Preliminary examination in October. <br>
2\.  Through Parent - Teacher meeting.

_Reporting Timetable_&nbsp;is as follows:
|Month|Types of Report|
| -------- | -------- |
|April|Progress Report for JC1 and JC2|
|End July|Mid Year Report for JC1 and JC2|
|Oct|Prelim Report for JC2|
|Early Nov|Overall Report for JC1|

_April, July and Nov student reports are forwarded to parents/guardians by post but the Prelim Exam Report for JC2 will be handed to the student on the last day of school._

**Absence from assessments**  
All students who miss any major internal examinations must be covered by&nbsp;**a medical certificate (MC)**&nbsp;or be given&nbsp;**exemption by DP / Studies with valid reason(s) (EX/VR)**.

**Exemption from Block Tests/ Examinations**

The following reasons may be considered&nbsp;**valid**&nbsp;for exemption.
|Month|Types of Report|
| -------- | -------- |
|(i) Competition and Performance (National &amp; International Level)|Teacher-in-charge must apply on behalf of students.&nbsp; The application form for exemption must be submitted to College Exams Committee for approval&nbsp;2 weeks&nbsp;before the commencement of Block Test or examinations.|
|(ii) Medical Grounds|Students must submit their medical certificates (MC) to their Civics Tutors immediately upon return to college.|
|(iii) Compassionate Grounds (e.g. death of NOK)|Students should inform their Civics Tutors as soon as possible and submit the relevant documents upon return to college.|

Students who are absent from Block tests with valid reasons&nbsp;are required to attempt the paper as an exercise&nbsp;and submit to teachers for grading. The marks will not be counted towards the final grade.

Students who absent without a valid reason will be given&nbsp;**zero**&nbsp;mark for that paper followed by disciplinary actions.

**Promotional Criteria for JC1**

Students will be promoted to JC 2 if they meet the following&nbsp;_**minimum criteria**_&nbsp;based on the Overall JC1 results: <br>
1\. Two H2 Pass (E-Grade) <br>
2\. One H2 Pass (E-Grade) and two H2 sub-pass (S-Grade)

_**Note:**_  
_(i)&nbsp; A H1 content subject pass (A to E grade) is equivalent to a H2 sub-pass (S-grade)_

_(ii) A General Paper pass (A to E grade) is also equivalent to a H2 sub-pass (S-grade)_

**Criteria to continue taking the expanded curriculum**&nbsp;  
(i.e. more than 3 H2 and 1 H1 subjects \[10 academic units\])

Students are allowed to offer the expanded curriculum in JC 2 provided the following minimum criteria, based on the overall JC1 results, are met. Otherwise, they will have to abide by the corresponding actions recommended.
