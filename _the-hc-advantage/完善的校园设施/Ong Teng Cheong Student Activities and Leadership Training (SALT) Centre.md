<img style="width:85%" src="/images/otcsalt.jpg">

The Ong Teng Cheong Student Activities and Leadership Training Centre is named in honour of distinguished Hwa Chong alumnus and Singapore's first elected President, Mr Ong Teng Cheong, who was both an outstanding leader and a passionate supporter of the Arts.&nbsp;

The Student Activities and Leadership Training (SALT) Centre serves as a platform to develop students holistically, particularly in areas of the arts and leadership excellence. Key features of the Centre include the Leadership Training Centre, the Performing Arts Centre, the Clubs and Societies Centre and the Student Resource Centre. The Leadership Centre also houses a multi-purpose hall modeled after the Singapore Parliamentary Chamber, creating the space for students to hone their debating skills and formulate policies directly impacting the student population.
