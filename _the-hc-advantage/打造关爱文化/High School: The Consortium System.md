##### High School: The Consortium System

Hwa Chong Institution took the bold but natural step of pioneering the Consortium System in 1999.&nbsp;

The Consortium System—which operates on the concept of a “school within a school”—was fully implemented in 2001. Each consortium comprises a team of about 30 teachers with a smaller cohort of students as their charges. At Hwa Chong Institution, teachers and students are grouped into 4 consortia, Aphelion, iSpark, Ortus and ProEd. With a smaller student population in each “minischool”, the nimble Consortium System allows for greater autonomy: staff members are empowered to make local decisions efficiently, so as to better respond to the changing needs of both students and teachers. The birth of the consortia led to a groundbreaking approach with a “start-up” culture imbued into the system. The Directors of Consortium, in tandem with the School Leaders, set up a system that was dynamic, flexible and responsive to the unique needs of the students and staff within each consortia.

The unique set up provides a more holistic, supportive and customised curriculum for our talented students. This in turn enables Hwa Chong Institution to nurture them into leaders, innovators and citizens of tomorrow.
