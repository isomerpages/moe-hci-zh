##### Pastoral Care

The Pastoral Care and Counselling Unit provides students with care, support and guidance through the challenges they face in school, enabling them to develop the disposition to live an engaged, meaningful and purposeful life. Through direct counselling and the unit’s self-management and development programmes, students are guided to regard their school challenges (and life challenges) as opportunities for deep personal insight and growth. 

When students encounter difficulties in their learning or school experiences, they may approach the School Counsellors for help. They should also not hesitate to seek the help of their Civics Tutor/Form Teachers or Faculty Teachers/Subject Teachers. The counsellors and teachers will assist them in identifying opportunities for personal growth, expanding their repertoire of coping resources and making personal changes that enable them to succeed in the social, education, career planning, and academic domains. 

The sessions between the student and counsellor are based on the principles of mutual respect and beneficence. It is a two-way process requiring commitment and effort from both counsellor and student. Counselling is confidential and students can be assured that what they share will be kept in strictest confidence.
