<p><strong>Direct School Admissions Selection Process</strong>
</p>
<p>Applicants will be shortlisted based on available information from MOE
and from applicants’ submitted information via the application process.</p>
<p>HCI will be conducting in-person selection for all DSA talent areas for
2024 DSA-Sec. Applicants who are successfully shortlisted will be informed
between 15 July to 19 July and they will be required to attend an interview
and/or selection tests on 27 July 2024. Due to the large number of applicants
and the limited number of DSA places, not all students who meet the criteria
will be shortlisted for an interview.</p>
<p>Please note that applicants should attend the in-person selection only
if they are well. For students who are unwell (e.g. tested COVID-19 positive)
during the selection period, re- scheduling the in-person selection will
be done where possible.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school for the duration of the 6-year
Integrated Programme, and participate in the activities related to the
talent area they are selected for from year 1-4.</p>
