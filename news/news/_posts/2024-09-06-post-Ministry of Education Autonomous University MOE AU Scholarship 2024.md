<p>Congratulations to Li Xinrui (22S7D) for being one of two recipients of
the Ministry of Education-Autonomous University (MOE-AU) Scholarship!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Xinrui received this prestigious award from Minister for Education Chan
Chun Sing on 14 Aug 2024. This scholarship is part of the Singapore Teaching
and Academic Research Talent (START) scheme, established in 2015 to nurture
future academic leaders. As an MOE-AU Scholar, Xinrui will receive comprehensive
support while pursuing his undergraduate studies in Physics, including
development opportunities and mentorship. Upon completing his studies,
he will continue to pursue a PhD and contribute to academia in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In his speech at the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent Scheme
(START) Award Ceremony, Minister Chan emphasised the need for scholars
to go beyond merely solving problems and instead focus on pre-empting issues
and seizing opportunities. He urged the recipients to address both local
and global challenges, particularly in areas like education, aging, and
sustainability, and to use their research to unlock new potential and drive
transformative change. Minister Chan concluded by encouraging the scholars
to be pioneers who turn challenges into opportunities, contributing to
Singapore's future growth and success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We wish Xinrui all the best in his academic journey ahead.</p>
