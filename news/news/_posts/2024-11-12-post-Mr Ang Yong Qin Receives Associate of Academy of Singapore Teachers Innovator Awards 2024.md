<p>Mr. Ang's project, the “Ipsative Student Assessment Tracker,” is an innovative
Excel interface designed to assist educators in tracking and analysing
student performance. This tool automatically generates visual reports and
requires no prior knowledge of Excel or coding, making it highly accessible
to teachers. By enabling the easy input of student results, the tracker
provides immediate, comprehensive insights into both individual and class-wide
academic progress, supporting personalised, data-driven instruction and
monitoring of students’ growth over time.</p>
<p>The “Ipsative Student Assessment Tracker” was developed with the aim of
fostering a growth mindset in students by focusing on personal development
and self-improvement. The tool was created in response to the need for
user-friendly solutions that simplify data analysis, aiding teachers in
customising their teaching approaches to better cater to students’ unique
needs.</p>
<p>This recognition underscores the significance of innovative educational
tools that enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of data analysis.
Mr. Ang's contribution highlights the importance of practical teaching
solutions in advancing educational excellence.</p>
