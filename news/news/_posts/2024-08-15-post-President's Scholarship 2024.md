<p>Dylan is set to attend the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue
his passion for data science, with aspirations to join the police force
after graduation, inspired by his grandfather's distinguished service in
the force.</p>
<p>“He took care of me growing up, and I remember being deeply inspired by
all the stories he told me,” Dylan said. “I saw how police officers would
put their lives on the line, and I knew that I wanted to join the police
then.”</p>
<p>Dylan received his awards from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam at the
President’s Scholarship award ceremony held at Shangri-La Hotel on 13 Aug
2024. In his speech, President Tharman highlighted the importance of Singapore's
public service being innovative, adaptable, and collaborative in an uncertain
world. He urged scholarship recipients to broaden their horizons, emphasizing
that the President’s Scholarship reflects their potential to inspire and
lead for the nation's betterment.</p>
<p>Wishing Dylan all the best as he embarks on this exciting journey!</p>
