<p><em>Presentation by Olympian Mr. Koh Seng Leong</em>
</p>
<p>On 5 Aug 2024, our Secondary 1 students heard from Mr. Lee Wung Yee, a
three-time Olympian specialising in Shooting. On 22 Aug 2024, our Secondary
2 students were inspired by Mr. Koh Seng Leong, a two-time Olympian in
Sailing who competed in both the Men's 470 Class and the single-men Laser
class.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee Wung Yee's session focused on the spirit of Olympism and its practical
application in daily life, leaving a lasting impression on our Secondary
1 students. Meanwhile, Mr. Koh Seng Leong captivated our Secondary 2 boys
with a simple yet touching and engaging sharing session. He encouraged
them to pursue their passions and shared valuable lessons from his Olympic
journey. Our students were fully engaged, and we’re grateful for the opportunity
to learn so much from these accomplished athletes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“I find today's sharing to be insightful as it showed us that as long as we believe in something, we will be able to soar to unparalleled heights. The speaker today also affirmed us to pursue our passions as well as gave us tips to improve at the fastest rate possible at our passion. Because of this presentation, I feel momentarily inspired to find a passion and, in turn, my ikigai. There was a quiz session afterwards by the Singapore Olympic Movement, if I am not wrong. It aimed to inspire passion in the Olympics at a young age and I think that it is a very noble aim. What the speaker accomplished in his time was during then, considered impossible. This shows that passion and potential, when combined together, makes miracles.”</em>
