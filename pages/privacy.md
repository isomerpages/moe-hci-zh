You may&nbsp; withdraw consent and request us to stop using and/or disclosing your personal data for&nbsp; any or all of the purposes listed above by submitting your request in writing or via email&nbsp; to our Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided below.&nbsp;

9\. Upon receipt of your written request or email to withdraw your consent, we may require&nbsp; reasonable time (depending on the complexity of the request and its impact on our&nbsp; relationship with you) for your request to be processed and for us to notify you of the&nbsp; consequences of us acceding to the same, including any legal consequences which may&nbsp; affect your rights and liabilities to us. In general, we shall seek to process your request&nbsp; within ten (10) business days of receiving it.&nbsp;

10\. Whilst we respect your decision to withdraw your consent, please note that depending on the nature and scope of your request, we may not be in a position to continue&nbsp; providing our products or services to you and we shall, in such circumstances, notify&nbsp; you before completing the processing of your request. Should you decide to cancel your&nbsp;
withdrawal of consent, please inform us in writing in the manner described in clause 8&nbsp; above.&nbsp;

11\. Please note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right to continue to collect,&nbsp; use and disclose personal data where such collection, use and disclose without consent&nbsp; is permitted or required under applicable laws.&nbsp;

**<u>ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL DATA&nbsp;</u>**

12\. If you wish to make (a) an access request for access to a copy of the personal data which&nbsp; we hold about you or information about the ways in which we use or disclose your&nbsp; personal data, or (b) a correction request to correct or update any of your personal data&nbsp; which we hold about you, you may submit your request in writing or via email to our&nbsp; Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided below.&nbsp;

13\. Please note that a reasonable fee may be charged for an access request. If so, we will&nbsp; inform you of the fee before processing your request.&nbsp;

14\. We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably possible. Should we not be able&nbsp; to respond to your request within thirty (30) days after receiving your request, we will&nbsp; inform you in writing within thirty (30) days of the time by which we will be able to&nbsp; respond to your request. If we are unable to provide you with any personal data or to&nbsp; make a correction requested by you, we shall generally inform you of the reasons why&nbsp; we are unable to do so (except where we are not required to do so under the PDPA).&nbsp;

**<u>PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA&nbsp;</u>**

15\. To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,&nbsp; copying, modification, disposal or similar risks, we have introduced appropriate&nbsp; administrative, physical and technical measures such as up-to-date antivirus protection,&nbsp; encryption and the use of privacy filters to secure all storage and transmission of&nbsp; personal data by us, and disclosing personal data both internally and to our authorised&nbsp; third party service providers and agents only on a need-to-know basis.


16\. You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or&nbsp; method of electronic storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed,&nbsp; we will strive to take all reasonable attempts to protect the security of your information&nbsp; and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our information security measures.&nbsp;

**<u>ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATA&nbsp;</u>**

17\. We generally rely on personal data provided by you (or your authorised representative).&nbsp; In order to ensure that your personal data is current, complete and accurate, please&nbsp; update us if there are changes to your personal data by informing our Data Protection&nbsp; Officer in writing or via email at the contact details provided below.&nbsp;

**<u>RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA&nbsp;</u>**

18\. We may retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for&nbsp; which it was collected, or as required or permitted by applicable laws.&nbsp;

19\. We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data can&nbsp; be associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no&nbsp; longer serves the purpose for which the personal data was collected, and is no longer&nbsp; necessary for legal or business purposes.&nbsp;

**<u>TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE OF SINGAPORE&nbsp;</u>**

20\. We generally do not transfer your personal data to countries outside of Singapore.&nbsp; However, if we do so, we will obtain your consent for the transfer to be made and we&nbsp; will take steps to ensure that your personal data continues to receive a standard of&nbsp; protection that is at least comparable to that provided under the PDPA.
