<center><b>Huangcheng 2023: An Evening of Drama</b><br>Written by: Tang Ee Han Ada (22A10), Ho Xuan Heng Brandon (22A14)</center>

Amidst new possibilities in the post-pandemic era, the College Chinese Society held its annual production,&nbsp;_An Evening of Drama (Huangcheng)_, at the High School Drama Centre on 12th&nbsp;and 13th&nbsp;May.&nbsp;

The theme of our production this year was “Dawn” (杲), which symbolises new beginnings. Like the rising sun, which illuminates the world with its radiance, we hope that we too can rise above our challenges, embrace the limitless potential within ourselves and move towards a brighter future. This theme was interwoven into our plays as they explored human connections that transcend all barriers, while depicting stories of hope, warmth and strength.&nbsp;

During the performance, our plays brought our audience on an emotional rollercoaster - from tear-jerking moments to comedy gold, from the infectious laughter of three script-writers to the deafening roar of a train engine, from the familial warmth of an unlikely friendship to the fiery passion of a young rock band…&nbsp;_Huangcheng_&nbsp;2023 was definitely an evening for all to remember!

Beyond these stories, this production also sought to unfold the unique and heart-warming experiences of every member off-stage. Without the dedication, teamwork and hard work of our 145 crew members across 12 departments, such a production would not have been possible. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to each and every participant who had worked tirelessly behind the scenes, as well as our teachers and peers who stood by us throughout this journey.&nbsp;

Lastly, we would like to give a special shout-out to the audience. Thank you for the opportunity to perform for three full houses across two days. Your unwavering support and heartfelt enthusiasm will motivate us to strive for greater heights. See you again at next year’s&nbsp;_An Evening of Drama_!
