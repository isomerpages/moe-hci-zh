Hwa Chong Educator, Mr Lim Zhan Yi, was conferred the 2022 Inspiring Teacher of English Award. This is a national award for English teachers who ignite a love for the English language in their students. It is presented by the Speak Good English Movement and The Straits Times, with the support of the Ministry of Education.

Mr Lim sums up his teaching philosophy as such: “I teach, so that I may one day become redundant to my students, for it is then that I know they have learnt to direct their own thinking.”
