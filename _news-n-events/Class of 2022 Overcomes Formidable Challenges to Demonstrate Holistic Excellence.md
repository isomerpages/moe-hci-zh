1 \. The Class of 2022 has attained a noteworthy set of results amidst challenging circumstances.&nbsp;

2 \. This cohort has been through a full two years of pandemic restrictions on their school life, including seeing the pandemic transition to its endemic state. They have even sat through two full national examinations under pandemic conditions. From limited group sizes, capacity limits to safe distancing, the richness of school life has been irrevocably changed for this cohort.&nbsp;

3 \. Proving their mettle under such circumstances, this cohort sustained a&nbsp;**median UAS**&nbsp;of&nbsp;**88\. Six out of 10**&nbsp;attained&nbsp;**3 H2 Distinctions and above**.&nbsp;**Four out of 10**&nbsp;scored&nbsp;**4 H2 distinctions and above**.&nbsp;**Three out of 10**&nbsp;had a&nbsp;**perfect UAS of 90.**

4 \. The following subjects&nbsp;**sustained an excellent performance:**

a)&nbsp;**5 out of 10**&nbsp;scored distinctions for&nbsp;**H1 General Paper**&nbsp;<br>
b)&nbsp;**8 out of 10**&nbsp;scored distinctions&nbsp;for&nbsp;**H1 Project Work**<br>
c)&nbsp;**8 out of 10**&nbsp;scored distinctions for&nbsp;**H2 Art**<br>
d)&nbsp;**6 out of 10**&nbsp;scored distinctions for&nbsp;**H2 Biology**&nbsp;<br>

m)&nbsp;**7 out of 10**&nbsp;scored distinctions for&nbsp;**H2 History**&nbsp;<br>

5 \. We are proud that our students continued to flourish, embodying the values of grit, adaptability and compassion. To be able to rise above their circumstances, these are all hallmarks of the Hwa Chong spirit of&nbsp;自强不息&nbsp;and&nbsp;饮水思源.&nbsp;

*   Channeling their energies to uplifting the community, the Class of 2022 creatively adapted to evolving pandemic restrictions, taking on&nbsp;**160**&nbsp;Service Learning Projects and impacting&nbsp;**close to 180**&nbsp;organizations and their beneficiaries. We hope that this school value of&nbsp;己立立人 ,&nbsp;己达达人 will guide them through life.
*   **Close to 75% of the cohort**&nbsp;have been conferred the&nbsp;**Hwa Chong Diploma**&nbsp;for holistic excellence; and
*   Contributed to&nbsp;**64 World Championship Titles**&nbsp;(2006-2023)

6 \. A testament to the value of a Hwa Chong education, numerous offers have been made to Hwa Chong students from local universities as well as established overseas universities. Our students also continue to be part of many prestigious university scholarship programmes which seek to nurture interdisciplinary thinkers, changemakers and leaders for the future. Provisional scholarships such as the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship have been offered to Hwa Chong students, before the release of the A-level results. This is evidence of the confidence and trust that our stakeholders have in our students’ all-round qualities.&nbsp;

7 \. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairmen and board members for your unwavering support, meticulous care and warm encouragement. It takes a village to raise a child, and an ecosystem to support a school.&nbsp;

8 \. Our gratitude also goes out to all in the Hwa Chong family including staff, past and present as well as parents and alumni who have always been the strong pillars and steady support for our students. We want to specially acknowledge and thank all the staff of Nanyang Girls’ High School and HCI for their care and commitment amidst changing circumstances.&nbsp;

9 \. As our graduates enter the next phase of their lives, we will continue in our steadfast mission to nurture our next generation of students to live with passion and lead with compassion. We will continue to encourage all to look beyond academic grades as a measure of success, embrace a myriad of opportunities and develop themselves holistically.

Heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2022! They have displayed tremendous resilience and demonstrated commitment and dedication in exceptional times, achieving holistic excellence in both academic and non-academic fields. This would not have been possible without the care, guidance and dedication of our teachers and staff; support from parents, Board members and alumni; as well as the hard work of our students.

**Hwa Chong Celebrates Holistic Excellence**

The Hwa Chong experience goes well beyond academic excellence. All students undergo a holistic education programme which empowers students to pursue their passion and serve the community. We would like to celebrate the achievements of a few of our students who especially embody the Hwa Chong vision for her students to ‘Live with Passion, Lead with compassion’.
