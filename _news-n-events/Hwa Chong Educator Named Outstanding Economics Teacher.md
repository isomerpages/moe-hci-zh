On how he inspires his students, Mr Chong has this to share,&nbsp;_“If we can find a purpose that is greater than ourselves, this will help us develop an indefatigable spirit. We will no longer count personal gains or losses, if we can see the greater good that is achieved in the lives of others.”_
