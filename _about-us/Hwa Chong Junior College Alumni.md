##### Hwa Chong Junior College Alumni

The HCJC Alumni was founded to foster friendships and maintain robust ties among Hwa Chong graduands. Besides supporting college and student activities, the HCJC Alumni also supports Hwa Chong students who require financial assistance. We believe every student should be given the opportunity to realise their full potential, and have been proactive in organising fundraising events in aid of the HCJC Alumni Bursary Fund.
